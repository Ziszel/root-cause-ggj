# Root Cause

Root Cause is a 2D investigation game that pits the player into the hands of former ace-detective, turned drunkard, 'Inspector'.

Inspector awakes, hungover, to find themselves in the house of a now dead drug baron. With little to go on for clues, and no memory of last nights events. Inspector has only their wit to work out what transpired here. Reinforcements will soon arrive on the scene and they will want answers.
